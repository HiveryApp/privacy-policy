# Privacy policy

Last modified: 15th June 2022

By using the getHivery.com website and making use of a Hivery Account (the "Account") and all its related features and apps, you understand that your data in relation with your use of our Services is processed according to the following privacy policy. This policy states (i) what data we collect through your access and uses of the Services; (ii) the use we make of such data; and (iii) the safeguards put in place to protect your data.

## 1\. Legal framework

The Services are operated by Ginger Cat Tech SL _- registration pending -_ (the "Company", "We"), domiciled at Calle Tarabilla 1, Corralejo, Las Palmas, 35660 Canary Islands(Spain - Europe). It is therefore governed by the laws and regulations of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands, the laws and regulations of Spain AND the laws and regulations of the European Union.

We are also GDPR compliant. As Ginger Cat Tech SL is established in the EU we do not need to designate a representative (notably for the purpose of art. 27 GDPR).

## 2\. Data collection and usage

Our overriding policy is to collect as little user information (personal data included) as possible to ensure a completely private user experience when using the Services.

Data collection is limited to the following:

2.1 Visiting our website: We employ a private installation of self-developed analytics tools. Analytics are anonymized stored within our own self-hosted databases. IP addresses are not retained and stored for such analytics.

2.2 Account creation: It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an Account, but you may provide an external contact address - such as email address, Discord Account, Telegram ID - for notification or password recovery purposes. Should you choose to provide it, we do associate this email address with your Account (for password recovery or notification purposes). Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about the Services, to send you information related to security, to verify your account or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may also inform you about new Hivery products and features in which you might have an interest. The legal basis for processing is consent and you are free to remove that data in your Account settings panel at any time.

In order to maintain the integrity of the Services, we must take measures to avoid creation of accounts by spammers. This is because if spammers use Hivery, they could increase load on our systems causing detriment to the quality of the service. In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers, we use a variety of human verification methods. Verification may also be requested for some sensitive operations besides account creation in order to protect against brute-force attacks. You may be asked to verify using either hCaptcha (or reCAPTCHA in the event that hCaptcha is unavailable), email, Discord, Telegram or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and for anti-spam purposes. The period of temporary data retention is determined by our legitimate interests of protecting the service from spam, and also by any applicable Local legal requirements we must comply with. If this data is saved permanently, it is always saved as a cryptographic hash, which ensures that the raw values cannot be deciphered by us.

2.3 Hivery Account activity: We have access to the following records of Account activity: number of Hives created, number of thoughts created, number and type of automations, number and type of integrations, amount of storage space used, last login time, active login sessions. User data is never used for advertising purposes.

2.4 Communicating with Hivery: Your communications with us, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more efficiently and improve the quality of our Services. For email communication with out teams we use Proton Mail which supports end-to-end encryption of emails.

2.5 IP logging: By default, we do not keep permanent IP logs in relation with your Account. However, IP logs may be kept temporarily to combat abuse and fraud. We anonymise all IP addresses making requests to our systems. We do this by randomizing the last octet of the IP address (0.0.0.x) . Your IP address may be retained permanently if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (e.g. spamming, DDoS attacks against our infrastructure, brute force attacks). The legal basis of this processing is our legitimate interest to protect our service against nefarious activities.

2.6 Payment information: We rely on third parties to process credit card, app-store and Bitcoin transactions and must therefore share payment information with them. The legal basis of this processing is the necessity to the execution of the contract to provide the Services.

2.7 Native applications: When you use our native applications, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information. We may use mobile analytics software (e.g. app statistics and crash reporting, Play Store app statistics, App Store app statistics, or self-hosted Sentry crash reporting) to send crash information to our developers in order to rapidly fix bugs. Some platforms, such as Google's Play Store or Apple's App Store may also collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, which may be governed by their respective privacy policies and terms and conditions. Such statistics can include most commonly used devices and operating systems (e.g. percentage of Android 6.x v. Android 7.x), total number of installs and uninstalls, and the total number of active users.

Our applications do not access or track any location-based information from your device.

## 3\. Data storage

Most servers used in connection with the provision of the Services are wholly owned and operated by the Company. Where the Company does not directly own or operate the servers, actions have been taken to ensure 3rd party providers are privacy aware and have in place all the necessary protections to protect your data. Linked below are the Data Protection Agreements for all 3rd party providers.

## 4\. Data subprocessors

To provide the Services, we rely on different data subprocessors, which process different categories of data. Processors never store data outside of the scope of their specific purpose. Notably, they do not store data in relation with the general day-to-day use of your Account and Services, which is exclusively processed by the Company. Subprocessors are as follow:

We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we are legally obligated to do so by a binding request coming from the competent Spanish authorities.

Hivery's general policy is to challenge requests whenever possible and where there are doubts as to the validity of the request or if there is a public interest in doing so. In such situations, we will not comply with the request until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted. Under Spanish law, subjects of judicial procedures have to be notified of such procedures, although such notification has to come from the authorities and not from the Company.

In case of violation of your rights, you have the right to lodge a complaint to the competent supervisory authority.

## 7\. Modifications to privacy policy

We reserve the right to periodically review and change this policy from time to time and will notify users who have enabled the notification preference about changes to our privacy policy.
This privacy policy is hosted publicly on GitHub and loaded onto our website via a custom proxy server to ensure no tracking information is sent to GitHub.
By hosting on GitHub all changes are tracked with timestamps in a publicly accessible way generating a timeline of all changes and modifications.
Continued use of the Services will be deemed acceptance of such changes.
